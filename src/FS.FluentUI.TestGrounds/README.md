## Contributing

When contributing to FS.FluentUI, include the added component(s)/ hook(s) to src/TestGrounds

Before doing anything, start with installing npm dependencies using `npm install`.

Then to start development mode with hot module reloading, run:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the development server after compiling the project, once it is finished, navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the application.

Alternatively
```bash
npm run jsx
```
This will start development server, but compile to jsx instead.
Change source bundle file in index.html to jsx
